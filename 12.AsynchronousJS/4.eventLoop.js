// EVENT LOOP

// first synchrnous are executed, then asynchronous are loaded at the same time but event loop prioritise microtask queue first(promises) then callbacks queue(normal callbacks)
//even though the setimeout is compplete way before 'resolved promise 2' its still ignored until microtask queue is completedðŸ¥²
