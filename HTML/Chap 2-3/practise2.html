        Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated
        animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers
        specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and
        Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word
        animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.
        Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are
        also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes
        and art styles that are sometimes labelled as anime.</pre
